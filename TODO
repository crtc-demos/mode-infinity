TODO
====

* Preload all assets: final pic in SR bank 5. Copper effect in shadow screen memory $3000-$6000.

* Modify scroller to use 8K screen size (and switch back for main effect!).

* Modify RLE decompressor to work with owl3z final picture. Interleave ROM bank accesses!

* Seamless transitions for tune parts. (IRQ -- or actually eventv -- whilst shuffling data between effects.)

* Import tunk's font (WIP)

* Make a stupid message.

* Effect buildup for parallax (big squares horizontal, big squares vertical, small squares appear, rotation, ...?)

* Import ruairi's tune (when ready)
