XFer in C Version 4.0
=====================

- Complete rewrite for Win32 (Windows 95/98/NT/2000) and Linux in C
  * Open source
  * Support for disc image downloading
  * Use of OSFILE to read file attributes
  * Extended .inf file format for file attributes
  * Improved CRC support
  * Support for recursive directory downloading
  * Support for multi-format disc filing systems (HDFS)

XFer Version 3.0
================

- Program now handles disk boot option (*OPT 4) parameter
  * When transferring an !BOOT file from a BBC to a PC, the disk
    boot option parameter is added to the !BOOT.INF file.
  * When transferring an !BOOT file from a PC to a BBC, while the
    !BOOT.INF file contains a boot option parameter, the correct
    boot option is set on the BBC disk.
  * See file FORMAT.TXT for explanation of syntax of !BOOT.INF.
  * (Note: boot option is transferred for every !BOOT file, even
    "non-bootable" !BOOT files, such as !BOOT files in directories
    other than $.)


XFer Version 2.3
================

- Bug fix
  * program crashing when transferring files with length of exact
    multiple of 4,000 bytes (4,000 bytes is BBC buffer size)
- More documentation on troubleshooting.


XFer Version 2.2
================

- Bug fix
  * program unable to transfer first file in BBC *INFO list if option
    "wildcards" turned on.
- More documentation on troubleshooting.


XFer Version 2.1
================

- Bug fix
  * program crashing when trying to transfer files from empty disks.
- Program renamed to XFer.


BBCXFer Version 2
=================

- Bug fixes:
  * program crashing when transferring 0-byte files;
  * no re-checking for existing file name (to prevent overwriting existing
    files) after incoming file has already been renamed.
- Improved instructions for making program work with non-standard DFSs
  and BBC Master.
- Added instructions on how to prevent problems when running BBCXFer
  under Windows95.
- Program confirmed to work with Acorn ADFS, many other DDFSs, and
  on BBC Master.

========================================

No modifications


BBCXFer version Beta 2
======================

- Bug fixes:
  * terminal emulator crashing in very specific circumstances;
  * program deadlocking after sending 17 files in a row to the BBC
    (was a pretty hard one!);
  * receiving files impossible without option "wildcards" set to off
    with standard Acorn DFS (it should only be necessary to set the option
    "wildcards" to off when using a DFS that is not compatible with a
    standard Acorn DFS).
- Improved instructions for making serial cable in case 25 pin PC port
  is used.
- Modified name of "image format for storing BBC files on other computers"
  to "standard format for storing BBC files on other computers" in all
  documents.
